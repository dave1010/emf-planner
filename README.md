# EMP: ElectroMagnetic Field Planner

A web app to help you plan your time at Electromagnetic Field, showing the schedule on a 2D timetable.

## Open the planner at [emp.dave.engineer](https://emp.dave.engineer)

The app is unofficial but takes the [official schedule](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024)
[API](https://developer.emfcamp.org/schedule/).

Status: works quite well but currently showing 2022 events as the 2024 feed not published.

Inspired by the
[Teddy Rocks Festival clash finder](https://teddyrocks.co.uk/lineup/clashfinder)
and [bus timetables](https://www.morebus.co.uk/services/WDBC/m2).

The code is currently vanilla HTML and JavaScript.
